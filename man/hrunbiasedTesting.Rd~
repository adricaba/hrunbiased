\details{
  Testing statistical significance of the relationship between a gene
  signature and recurrence can be done by considering both asymptotic
  distributions or random signature based distributions. The
  interpretation of the two is different: asymptotic testing finds
  evidence against the null hypothesis  HR = 1;  random signatures
  quantifies how special is the relation of a gene signature to
  recurrence in comparison to any possible random set of genes.

  A useful correction we consider is the adjusment by a global signature
  which uses the information of all genes and that may point towards
  technical / sampling directions. This global signature can be
  influenced by both technical and biological effects. In order to
  reduce the biological impact, adjusting variables are determined by
  negative control signatures based on a score ordered from low to high.
  For example, we suggest to use a measure of dispersion so that only
  low-variable genes are used in an  adjusting signature. Other scores
  based on cross-study reproducibility or any sort of biological prior
  information could also be employed. See
  \code{\link{hrunbiasedDiagnostic}} for more details in selecting the
  correction type.

  For \code{seqquant = 0}, then the correction type coincides with
  \code{correction.type = "none"} and for \code{seqquant = 1} then  the
  correction type coincides with  \code{correction.type = "Gsignature"}.
